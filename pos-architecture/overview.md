# PoS V2.5 - Age of Gurdians Overview

The Orbs Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Universe is the backbone of the Orbs network and the Universe that is being created.

The second generation of the Orbs PoS Universe V2.5: The Age of Guardians, further empowers the Orbs Universe Guardians to take an active role in building and maintaining a secure, scalable network, that will be the first choice for blockchain adoption.

> As of march 29 2022, Orbs network supports both ETH and Polygon networks. Everything which is described in this document applies to both.
## Roles

The Orbs PoS Universe has two main roles:

* Delegators
* Guardians

### Delegators

Delegators are ORBS token holders who assign their voting weight (stake) to Guardians, empowering them to maintain security and uphold the long term vision of the ecosystem.

#### Responsibilities

* Actively contribute to the network’s success by staking your ORBS tokens. Read [these instructions](https://www.orbs.com/tetra-orbs-staking-wallet-tutorial/) on how to stake using the Orbs Tetra wallet.
* Select a worthy [Guardian](https://staking.orbs.network/guardians) to delegate your voting power to.
* Staked tokens will be locked for a period of 14 days. Read more on the [Orbs locking mechanism](https://www.orbs.com/introducing-locking-when-staking-orbs/).

#### Economic Incentives

* Token holders that delegate to an active Guardian are rewarded in proportion to their stake.
* Annual reward is up to 8% of the Delegator’s staked tokens (subject to an 80M Orbs Token cap on total rewards). Find out more about the [Orbs reward system](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians-section-rewards-fees-bootstrap-fund/).
* Only delegation to an active Guardian that participates in the elected committee receives rewards. Also, it is important to note that staking rewards may vary between Guardians, so choose your Guardian carefully!

### Guardians

Orbs Guardians represent the Orbs community; they maintain the security of the network and uphold its long term vision, investing time and efforts in the network success.

#### Responsibilities

* Guardians operate the Orbs network nodes and run the virtual chains for the subscribed applications.
* Guardians are responsible for the [staking rewards distribution](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians-section-rewards-distributions/) to their community of delegators.
* Orbs is a [hybrid blockchain](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians-section-pos-on-ethereum/), utilizing Ethereum and Polygon for added security and transparency of the Orbs PoS ecosystem. Thus, Orbs Guardians are required to run an Ethereum node.
* Guardians have an option to be part of the [Certified Committee](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians-section-election-committees/) and operate virtual chains that require certified Guardians. Certified Committee members are eligible for added incentives.
Guardians are expected to be committed to their communities and their Delegators’ staked tokens. Therefore, Guardians are required to have a [self-stake](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians-section-minimum-self-delegation/) of at least 8% of their total delegated stake.

#### Economic Incentives

* Applications running virtual chains on Orbs pay fees directly to the Guardians, representing the cost of the computational resources allocated to the virtual chain.
* Guardians receive [staking rewards](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians-section-rewards-fees-bootstrap-fund/) of at least 4% of their delegated stake (subject to an 80M Orbs Token cap on total rewards), for operating the network and contributing to the network’s security.
* Guardians who choose to participate in the Certified Committee receive a [bootstrap fund](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians-section-rewards-fees-bootstrap-fund/) distributed in DAI.

# The Certificatied Committee
The certified committee is a subset of the Orbs committee that includes only Guardians that received certification. The guardian receives certification upon publishing the guardians identification data. The certificatied committee is designed to meet enterprise application needs, where the anonymity of the ones operating the network may be  a barrier for many to transition to blockchain. 

When a new virtual chain is created, the creator may choose to operate the virtual chain on the general committee or the certified committee. The fees for the virtual chain are paid only for the committee operating the virtual chian. As a reason two instances of the fees contract are deployed, one for each committee.

In order to incentivise guardians to identify, thus increasing the stake of the certified committee, a bootstrap fund of 3000 DAI annually is awarded to each member of the certified committee for the period they participated in the committee.

> Certification is done only on ETH network and disabled for Polygon.

> virtual chain contracts are not deployed or managed on Polygon network.
